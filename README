1. Introduction
---------------

This package  provides a  dynamic module for  GNU Emacs  implementing an
interface to the GMP library on top of a C11 language library.

  The library targets POSIX systems.  This package is meant to work with
GNU Emacs version 26+ and GMP version 6.2.0+.  This package depends upon
the  external packages:  cl-lib.  To  run the  test suite:  this package
requires the ERT package.

  The package uses the GNU Autotools  and it is tested, using Travis CI,
on both Ubuntu  GNU+Linux systems and OS X systems.   The package relies
on "pkg-config" to find the dependencies installed on the system.

  Here is a usage snippet:

(require 'gmp)

(let ((rop      (mpf))
      (op1      (mpf 1.2))
      (op2      (mpf 3.4)))
  (mpf-add rop op1 op2)
  (let ((base           10)
        (ndigits        17))
    (mpf-get-str* base ndigits rop)))
=> "+0.45999999999999999e+1"

3. Install
----------

First make sure that your GNU Emacs installation has enabled support for
dynamic modules.   Check the elisp variable  "module-file-suffix": if it
is  set  to  nil, modules  are  disabled  and  we  need to  rebuild  and
reinstall the GNU Emacs package.

  To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mmux-emacs-gmp-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-emacs-gmp

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-emacs-gmp

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmux-emacs-gmp
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The  C  language shared  library  is  installed under  "$libdir",  for
example:

			    /usr/local/lib64

while the Emacs code goes under "$lispdir", for example:

		    /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp

so to load the module we should do something like:

   (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/lib64"
                           "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp")
   (require gmp)


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.
